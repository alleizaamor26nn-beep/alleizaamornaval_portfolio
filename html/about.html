      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi I'm Alleiza, a student with hands-on experience in developing systems for academic purposes. 
        I have worked on several projects, including a Violation Record Management System using <strong>C# in Visual Studio 2012</strong>, where I collaborated with a partner, and a Point of Sale System developed using <strong>VB.NET</strong>, also with a teammate. I have also independently created a Mini Library System using <strong>VB.NET</strong> that allows users to borrow books, view available books, and perform basic CRUD operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have basic experience working with databases, mainly using <strong>MySQL</strong> through <strong>phpMyAdmin and XAMPP (localhost)</strong>, and I understand how table relationships work and how data flows within a system. 
        I have also tried developing a PC Inventory System website using <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, as well as creating simple games using <strong>C# and RPG Maker</strong>. 
        In addition, I am familiar with <strong>Figma</strong> for creating UI prototypes and have used <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> for school-related activities. 
        I am also a <strong>NC II holder in Computer Systems Servicing</strong>, which gave me foundational knowledge in computer hardware and troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although most of my projects were created for school requirements, they helped me discover my strengths. 
        I learned that I am a creative thinker who often comes up with ideas to further improve a system, even when the main concept is already defined. 
        I enjoy designing interfaces and improving user experience, and I consider myself more inclined toward <strong>front-end development</strong>, 
        while still understanding the logic behind system and database design. I am eager to continue learning, improving my skills, and gaining real-world experience. </p>
